              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a passionate
              and highly motivated full stack developer with experience using
              frontend and backend technologies such as JavaScript, ReactJS,
              Bootstrap, Material-UI, Node, Ruby, Sinatra, and Rails. I am
              committed to writing clean, readable and scalable code!<br></br>{" "}
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated from
              New York University, where I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in
              chemical engineering and immersed myself in mathematics, physics
              and engineering. I found my love for coding after college and wish
              to become a seasoned and professional software engineer!
              <br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have
              recently graduated from Flatiron School's 15 week immersive boot
              camp and would love to apply my problem solving and programming
              and team-oriented skill set to help clients and companies meet
              their goals.
